# Little Learners

This web application is designed to make learning engaging and accessible for children by allowing them to explore a variety of educational materials, receive guidance from teachers and parents, and participate in quizzes to earn points and badges. With Little Learners, children can study from the comfort of their home, at their own pace, without the early morning rush to school.

## How It Works

Little Learners operates as a web application that provides an interactive and supportive learning environment for children. Here’s a brief overview of how it functions:

1. **Explore Learning Materials**: Children can access a wide range of educational resources tailored to their age and learning level.
2. **Guidance from Educators**: Teachers and parents can offer support, ensuring that children have the help they need as they navigate their learning journey.
3. **Quizzes and Assessments**: Children can test their knowledge through quizzes, which not only reinforce learning but also keep them engaged.
4. **Points and Badges**: As children complete learning activities and quizzes, they earn points and badges, motivating them to continue their educational journey.

## File Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

1. **client Folder**: This contains all the files related to the user interface, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for building a responsive and interactive experience for frontend team.
2. **server Folder**: This contains the server-side code, including APIs and database interactions that power the application’s functionality for the backend team.
